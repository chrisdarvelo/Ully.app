# Ully AI — Product Vision & Roadmap

> This document captures the long-term product direction, strategic priorities,
> and build roadmap for Ully AI. Updated as the vision evolves.
> For technical architecture and dev commands, see CLAUDE.md.

## What Ully Is Becoming

Ully began as a coffee companion. The long-term vision is a category-defining platform:

**Ully is a purpose-built professional intelligence platform for skilled trades and
supply-chain industries — starting with coffee, expanding to every domain where
expert knowledge is locked inside people's heads and unavailable at the moment
it is needed most.**

The core product belief:
> Professionals in the field — a barista dialling in at 6am, a technician
> diagnosing a faulty group head mid-service, a café owner reconciling labour
> cost against daily covers — need expert-level answers and actionable business
> data immediately. Not after a Google search, not after a call to a consultant.
> Ully puts that capability in their pocket, tailored to their trade.

## Positioning

| What Ully is | What Ully is not |
|---|---|
| A purpose-built professional tool for the coffee industry | A general-purpose chatbot |
| Domain-specific, opinionated, and expert-calibrated | Broad, vague, or hedging |
| Offline-capable and field-ready | Dependent on a continuous connection |
| Grounded in a proprietary curated knowledge base | Relying solely on AI generation |
| A connected platform spanning the supply chain | A single-use consumer application |
| Custom-engineered tool integrations for real workflows | A generic dashboard bolted onto third-party data |

---

## Phase 1 — Ully Coffee (Current)

**Status:** Built. Android APK in internal testing. iOS pending Apple Developer enrollment.

**Who it serves:** Baristas, home enthusiasts, café owners, coffee professionals.

**Core features:**
- AI chat assistant (Claude Sonnet) — coffee-only, precision responses, no preamble
- Weather-aware drink and brew recommendations
- Espresso dial-in assistant with photo analysis
- Focused home screen: logo + greeting + single "ask ully" CTA — no feed, no distractions

**HomeScreen architecture decision (resolved):**
The home screen was stripped of the feed (recipes, baristas, cafes, news) and simplified to a
single-purpose landing: greet the user, surface a rotating coffee tip, and send them to AI.
This is the correct call for a professional tool — content feeds are a distraction, not a feature.
Feed items (recipes, barista content, café maps, news) are documented below as deferred.

**Deferred social features (reinstated post-launch):**
- Personal recipe library with procedural art covers — removed from v1, planned for Phase 2
- Curated barista content and blog feed — removed from v1, planned for Phase 2
- Café bookmarking and personal coffee map — removed from v1, planned for Phase 2
- Coffee news aggregation (Perfect Daily Grind, Barista Magazine, Daily Coffee News) — removed from v1, planned for Phase 2

**Planned (Phase 1b — Ully Learn):**
- Duolingo-style coffee knowledge apprentice system
- Four tiers matching onboarding roles: Amateur → Semi-Pro → Barista → Champion
- Each tier contains 10 progressive stages (lessons + quizzes)
- Completing onboarding automatically places user in Amateur tier Stage 1
- Progression unlocks next tier; Champion tier targets competition-level barista knowledge
- See Phase 1b section below for full design

**Launch blocklist:**
- [ ] Apple Developer Program enrollment
- [ ] Google Play Console internal testing sign-off
- [ ] Google Play Console store listing + data safety form
- [ ] Production EAS build (AAB) for Play Store submission

---

## Phase 1b — Ully Learn (Apprentice System)

**Status:** Designed. Not yet built.

### Concept

A Duolingo-style progressive coffee knowledge system embedded in the app.
Users earn their way through four tiers that mirror the real coffee career ladder.

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Who it's for | Stages |
|---|---|---|
| Amateur | Home enthusiasts, new to specialty coffee | 10 |
| Semi-Pro | Experienced home brewers, aspiring baristas | 10 |
| Barista | Working baristas, café staff | 10 |
| Champion | Competition-level, World Barista Championship caliber | 10 |

**Total: 40 stages across 4 tiers.**

### Progression Rules

1. Completing onboarding automatically places the user in **Amateur, Stage 1**.
2. Each stage = a short lesson (3–5 screens) + a quiz (5–8 questions).
3. Passing a quiz (≥80%) unlocks the next stage.
4. Completing all 10 stages in a tier unlocks the next tier.
5. Tier completion grants a badge displayed on the user's profile.
6. Users who selected "Barista" in onboarding start at Semi-Pro Stage 1 (skips Amateur).
7. Users who selected "Organization" in onboarding start at Barista Stage 1.

### Sample Stage Topics

**Amateur (1–10)**
1. What is specialty coffee? Grading and scoring.
2. Brewing methods overview: espresso, pour over, French press, AeroPress.
3. Coffee origins: Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil — taste profile basics.
4. Grind size and its effect on extraction.
5. Water quality and temperature fundamentals.
6. Reading a coffee bag: roast date, process, variety.
7. Espresso basics: dose, yield, time (the recipe triangle).
8. Milk basics: steaming temperature, microfoam vs. foam.
9. Barista tools: tamper, scale, timer, portafilter.
10. How to taste coffee: the flavor wheel.

**Semi-Pro (1–10)** — dial-in, extraction, water chemistry, latte art fundamentals...

**Barista (1–10)** — SCA protocols, workflow optimization, customer service, calibration...

**Champion (1–10)** — WBC judging criteria, signature drink design, sensory science, terroir...

### Architecture (future implementation)

```
AsyncStorage key: @ully_learn_progress_{uid}

{
  tier: 'amateur' | 'semi-pro' | 'barista' | 'champion',
  stage: number,          // 1–10
  completedStages: string[],  // ['amateur-1', 'amateur-2', ...]
  badges: string[],       // ['amateur', 'semi-pro', ...]
  lastActivity: number,   // timestamp
}
```

Screens needed:
- `LearnScreen.tsx` — tier map + progress rings (tab 3 or modal from Home)
- `StageScreen.tsx` — lesson slides + quiz flow
- `BadgeScreen.tsx` — earned badge showcase
- `LessonContent.ts` — static lesson + quiz data per stage (JSON or TS object)

## Ully Web — Business Platform

**Status:** Live on Railway (March 2026).
**Repo:** `~/ully-web/` — separate git repo from the mobile app.

The web platform is Ully's desktop-first B2B product. It targets café owners, managers,
and multi-site operators who need a real operational workspace, not a mobile companion.
It runs independently of Firebase — fully self-contained with SQLite + JWT auth.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind v4 (same design tokens as mobile) |
| Database | SQLite via better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM |
| Auth | JWT (httpOnly cookie, org-scoped sessions) |
| AI | Claude API — streaming chat, context-aware |
| Hosting | Railway |
| Charts | DashboardCharts (custom, no lib dependency) |

### Live Modules

| Module | Route | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | `/dashboard` | Revenue KPIs, machine health, team count, 7-day revenue + expense charts |
| **Ully AI** | `/chat` | Full streaming chat with business context awareness — parity with mobile |
| **Equipment** | `/equipment` | Machine registry (type, brand, model, serial, status) + per-machine service record log |
| **Team** | `/team` | Team member management — roles, hourly rates, start dates, status |
| **Training** | `/training` | Session logging per team member — topic, score (★★★★☆), trainer notes |
| **Schedule** | `/schedule` | Weekly calendar view for shift planning |
| **Inventory** | `/inventory` | Stock management |
| **Revenue** | `/revenue` | Revenue + expense records, P&L tracking |
| **Settings** | `/settings` | Org profile management |

### Marketing Pages (live)

| Page | Route |
|---|---|
| Landing | `/` |
| Products | `/products` |
| About | `/about` (founder photo placeholder at `/public/images/founder.jpg`) |
| Pricing | `/pricing` |
| Privacy, Terms, Cookies | `/(legal)/` |

### Layout Pattern

The platform uses `PlatformShell` — a persistent sidebar + main content area. The sidebar
carries the ULLY brand, org name + role header, and gold-accented active states for each module.
This is the same dark gold design language as the mobile app — consistent across platforms.

```
PlatformShell
├── Sidebar (240px, dark #080604)
│   ├── Brand: ULLY / business platform
│   ├── Org name + role
│   └── Nav: Dashboard → AI → Equipment → Team (Schedule, Training) → Inventory → Revenue → Settings
└── Main content area
    └── Page content (module-specific)
```

Visual anchors present on all public pages:
- `CoffeeFarmScene.tsx` — pixel-art SVG coffee farm at the bottom of every marketing page
- `FlowerIcon.tsx` — the Ully coffee blossom SVG logo used in all nav bars
- Terminal bracket nav links `[ link ]` — consistent across marketing pages

---

## Phase 2 — Professional Operations Layer

**Status:** Infrastructure partially built. See Espresso Studios section below.

This phase deepens Ully's value for the two highest-leverage professional personas:
**espresso technicians** and **working baristas**. Both need tools that go beyond
AI chat — they need structured, longitudinal records tailored to their daily workflow.

---

## Espresso Studios — Cross-Platform Layout Infrastructure

**Status:** Foundation built across both platforms. Mobile screens exist, not yet wired to nav. Web is live.

"Espresso Studios" is the internal name for the professional operations workspace that spans
both the mobile app and the web platform. It is the B2B product layer — a consistent,
purposeful layout system where coffee businesses manage machines, teams, training, and finances.

The name reflects the target user's world: a studio-grade professional environment designed
around espresso as the commercial core of a coffee operation.

### What it is

Not a dashboard bolted on. Not a generic CRUD app. A purpose-built professional workspace
where every module is engineered around the daily decisions of a café operator or technician.
The AI layer is integrated throughout — not isolated to a chat tab.

### Cross-Platform Architecture

```
Espresso Studios
├── Mobile (Ully Coffee — screens/business/)
│   ├── BusinessDashboardScreen     — KPI overview + "Ask Ully AI" with prefilled operational prompt
│   ├── MaintenanceScreen           — Machine registry + service record logging + color-coded health
│   └── TeamScreen                  — Team roster + training session XP system
│
└── Web (Ully Web — /platform/)
    ├── /dashboard                  — Live KPIs + 7-day revenue/expense charts
    ├── /chat                       — Ully AI with business context awareness
    ├── /equipment                  — Full machine + service record CRUD
    ├── /team                       — Team roster with roles + hourly rates
    ├── /training                   — Training log per member, scored by topic
    ├── /schedule                   — Weekly shift calendar
    ├── /inventory                  — Stock management
    └── /revenue                    — P&L records
```

### Shared Data Model (same entities, two storage layers)

| Entity | Mobile (AsyncStorage) | Web (SQLite / Drizzle) |
|---|---|---|
| Machines | `@ully_machines_{uid}` | `equipment` table |
| Service records | `@ully_service_records_{uid}` | `serviceRecords` table |
| Team members | `@ully_team_members_{uid}` | `teamMembers` table |
| Training sessions | `@ully_training_logs_{uid}` | `trainingLogs` table |
| Revenue / expenses | — | `revenueRecords`, `expenseRecords` tables |
| Inventory | — | `inventory` table |

**Phase 3 goal:** Firestore sync bridges the two layers — mobile data feeds the web dashboard
and vice versa. This requires the Business tier account model from Phase 3.

### Mobile Layout Pattern

Mobile business screens follow a consistent pattern:

```
PaperBackground (dark gradient)
└── SafeAreaView
    ├── Header — screen title, "+" add button
    ├── ScrollView — entity list with status indicators
    │   └── Card — entity summary (name, type, status color)
    └── BottomSheet (modal) — add / edit forms
        └── FormField — labelled text input, reusable across all screens
```

Reusable components in `components/business/`:
- `BottomSheet.tsx` — slide-up modal for all add/edit forms
- `FormField.tsx` — labelled text input with consistent dark gold styling

### Web Layout Pattern

Web business screens follow the PlatformShell pattern:

```
PlatformShell
├── Sidebar — persistent, 240px, dark
│   └── Gold active state on current module
└── Main area — module-specific content
    ├── Header — page title + primary action button
    ├── Data table or card grid — entity list
    └── Inline form panel — add/edit (no modal, no navigation away)
```

### AI Integration Points

The AI is not a separate tab bolted onto the operations workspace. It is wired in:

| Platform | Integration |
|---|---|
| Mobile | `BusinessDashboardScreen` has a gold "Ask Ully AI" button that navigates to AI tab with a prefilled operational prompt |
| Web | `/chat` receives business context (equipment status, team, recent revenue) — AI answers are grounded in the org's actual data |

**Planned:** Push-style alerts — Ully proactively surfaces maintenance overdue, low inventory,
or margin alerts without the user asking. This is the "AI operating system for the café" vision.

### Machine Health Colour System (Mobile)

Colour-coded maintenance urgency — used in `MaintenanceScreen`:

| Days since last service | Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| < 30 days | Green `#4CAF50` | Healthy |
| 30–60 days | Amber `#FF9800` | Due soon |
| > 60 days | Red `#F44336` | Overdue |

### Training XP System (Mobile)

`TeamScreen` uses an XP model to gamify barista development:

```ts
XP per session = durationMinutes × (managerScore ?? selfScore)
Monthly XP displayed as a progress bar (cap: 500 XP)
```

This gives managers a quick visual signal of who is training and at what intensity —
without needing to open each individual session log.

### What remains to build

**Mobile:**
- [ ] Wire `screens/business/` into `AppNavigator` behind the org role gate
- [ ] Add a 4th tab (or modal entry point) for Business users
- [ ] Push notifications for maintenance overdue alerts
- [ ] Photo capture on service records (camera → AsyncStorage)

**Web:**
- [ ] Schedule: shift assignment (currently calendar shell only)
- [ ] Inventory: reorder thresholds + low-stock alerts
- [ ] Revenue: chart breakdowns by category
- [ ] Firestore sync bridge (Phase 3 — requires Business tier accounts)
- [ ] Founder photo at `/public/images/founder.jpg`
- [ ] Railway public domain → DNS propagation (GoDaddy → Railway)
- [ ] Redirect / take down old Firebase static site (ully-coffee.web.app)

### 2a — Offline Knowledge Base

**The problem:** Ully currently requires an internet connection for every AI response.
Professionals work in cellars, roasting facilities, machine rooms, and remote locations
where connectivity is unreliable or absent.

**The solution:** A curated, proprietary knowledge base authored from verified domain
expertise, queryable on-device with no API call required.

#### Architecture

```
User question
      ↓
KnowledgeService (SQLite FTS5 — on-device)
      ↓
 offline?  ──YES──▶  Return best KB match as Ully response
      │
      NO
      ↓
Inject top KB match as grounding context into Claude system prompt
      ↓
Claude API response (enhanced and grounded by KB context)
```

#### Knowledge Base Structure

Each entry:
```json
{
  "id": "espresso-bitter-001",
  "category": "troubleshooting",
  "method": "espresso",
  "question": "Why is my espresso bitter?",
  "tags": ["bitter", "over-extraction", "grind", "temperature"],
  "answer": "Full expert answer here...",
  "related": ["espresso-sour-001", "grind-size-001"]
}
```

#### Target Categories (v1 KB)

| Category | Target entries |
|---|---|
| Espresso troubleshooting | 40–50 |
| Filter / pour over methods | 25–30 |
| Equipment maintenance | 30–40 |
| Water chemistry | 15–20 |
| Grinder calibration | 15–20 |
| Milk texturing / latte art | 20–25 |
| Dial-in guides per method | 10–15 |
| Roast basics | 15–20 |
| Café ops / workflow | 15–20 |
| **Total** | **~200 entries** |

#### Why this matters

- Reduces Claude API costs — common questions resolved by the KB, not the API
- Makes Ully field-ready — works anywhere, anytime, without a connection
- The KB is proprietary — competitors cannot replicate it by using Claude
- Grounds Claude's answers in verified, curated expertise

#### Files to create

```
services/KnowledgeService.ts     — SQLite FTS5 search, ranked results
assets/knowledge/coffee.json     — authored knowledge base
hooks/useUllyChat.ts             — KB check before/alongside Claude
```

### 2b — Maintenance Schedule Tracking

**Who it serves:** Espresso technicians, café owners, head baristas managing equipment.

**Status:** Core built. Mobile screen (`MaintenanceScreen.tsx`) + service (`MaintenanceService.ts`) complete.
Web equivalent live at `/equipment`. Not yet exposed in mobile nav (behind org role gate).

**The problem:** Equipment maintenance in the coffee industry is managed informally —
paper logs, memory, or nothing at all. Missed maintenance intervals mean machine
failure mid-service, voided warranties, and costly emergency callouts. No purpose-built
mobile tool exists for technicians managing multi-site fleets.

**The solution:** A structured, on-device maintenance log tailored to commercial
espresso equipment — custom-engineered for the technician's workflow, not adapted
from a generic maintenance app.

#### Core functionality (built)

- Machine registry — type (espresso_machine, grinder, water_treatment, other), location, serial
- Service log — log each visit: service type, technician note, parts replaced
- Service type options: `group_service`, `boiler_flush`, `descale`, `gasket_replacement`, `grinder_calibration`, `custom`
- Color-coded machine health (green < 30 days, amber 30–60, red > 60 days since last service)

#### Remaining to build

- Push reminders — notify before service interval expires
- Photo capture on service records
- Multi-site view — one list across all org locations
- Custom interval configuration per machine + service type

#### Schema per service record

```ts
{
  id: string
  machineId: string
  serviceType: 'group_service' | 'boiler_flush' | 'descale' | 'gasket_replacement' | 'grinder_calibration' | 'custom'
  completedAt: string       // ISO timestamp
  technicianNote: string
  partsReplaced?: string[]
  photoUri?: string
  nextDueAt: string         // calculated from interval setting
}
```

**AsyncStorage key:** `@ully_service_records_{uid}` + `@ully_machines_{uid}`

**Phasing:** v1 is on-device only. Multi-technician sync (shared Firestore) is Phase 3
when the Business tier is live.

---

### 2c — Training Logs & Personal Performance

**Who it serves:** Baristas at all levels — from new hires tracking their development
to competition-level professionals logging prep sessions. Also café managers tracking team development.

**Status:** Core built on both platforms. Mobile: `TeamScreen.tsx` + `TeamService.ts`.
Web: `/training` module live. Not yet exposed in mobile nav (behind org role gate).

**The problem:** Barista skill development is tracked informally or not at all.
Coaches provide feedback verbally. Competition prep sessions are undocumented.
There is no tool purpose-built for tracking a barista's longitudinal performance.

**The solution:** A structured training log that captures session data, ties it to
Ully AI feedback, and gives the barista a clear view of their progression over time —
custom-made for the professional barista, not adapted from a fitness tracker.

#### Core functionality (built)

- Team member roster — role (barista, head_barista, manager), linked to training sessions
- Session log — drill type, duration, self-score, optional manager score, trainer notes
- Drill types: `espresso_workflow`, `milk_texture`, `cupping`, `latte_art`, `customer_service`, `custom`
- XP system — `durationMinutes × score` per session, monthly XP bar per member
- Web topics: espresso technique, latte art, cupping, equipment, customer service, food safety, roasting, brew methods

#### Remaining to build

- Progression chart — self-assessed scores over time per skill area (mobile)
- Ully AI integration — auto-attach a chat exchange to a training session
- Competition prep mode — structured WBC-style session logging

#### Schema per session (mobile)

```ts
{
  id: string
  memberId: string              // links to TeamMember
  createdAt: string
  drillType: DrillType          // 'espresso_workflow' | 'milk_texture' | 'cupping' | 'latte_art' | 'customer_service' | 'custom'
  durationMinutes: number
  selfScore: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
  managerScore?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
  notes: string
  coachNotes?: string
  linkedChatId?: string         // attaches a Ully AI exchange to the session
}
```

**AsyncStorage keys:** `@ully_team_members_{uid}` + `@ully_training_logs_{uid}`

---

### 2d — User Feedback & Dataset Pipeline

**The problem:** The offline KB starts with manually authored entries. To grow it
faster and reflect real user questions, Ully needs a voluntary feedback loop where
users contribute Q&A pairs back to the knowledge base.

**What this is not:** Fine-tuning Claude. Anthropic does not allow model fine-tuning
via the API. This is a **feedback pipeline that informs KB authoring** — contributions
are reviewed by a human and promoted into the offline KB. Never describe this as
"training the AI" in UI copy.

#### User-facing flow

```
User asks question → Claude answers
        ↓
Subtle thumbs row appears below response (not a modal)
  👍  👎  · Share to improve Ully
        ↓
User taps "Share to improve Ully"
        ↓
Single confirmation sheet:
  "This Q&A will be sent anonymously to help improve
   Ully's knowledge base. No personal info is included."
  [ Send anonymously ]   [ No thanks ]
        ↓
Q&A pair + metadata written to Firestore feedback collection
        ↓
You review → strong entries authored into offline KB
```

#### When to show the prompt

Do not prompt after every message. Show only when:
- Response is 3+ sentences long
- User has not been prompted in the last 10 messages
- User has not disabled feedback prompts in Settings

#### Firestore schema

```
feedback/{autoId}
  question:    string
  answer:      string
  rating:      'helpful' | 'not_helpful'
  shared:      boolean
  method:      string | null    — espresso, pour_over, etc. if detectable
  category:    string | null    — troubleshooting, technique, etc.
  appVersion:  string
  createdAt:   timestamp
  // NO uid, NO email, NO location — anonymous by design
```

#### Privacy requirements before shipping

- Explicit opt-in only — never collect silently
- Update `public/privacy.html` to disclose feedback collection
- Update Play Store data safety form
- Add feedback opt-out toggle in Settings screen
- Firestore rules must restrict feedback collection to authenticated writes, no client reads

#### The compounding effect

```
Users share feedback
      ↓
Identify the 20 most frequently asked questions
      ↓
Author those as KB entries with expert-level answers
      ↓
KB entries serve those questions offline at zero API cost
      ↓
Better answers → more sharing → more KB entries → better Ully
```

This is how the proprietary crop-to-cup dataset starts — not with a data
engineering project, but with a feedback button and human curation.

---

## Phase 3 — Ully Business

**Status:** Foundation built (Espresso Studios — mobile + web). Data sync and integrations are next.
Target: 6–12 months post-launch.

**Who it serves:** Café owners, multi-site operators, hospitality group managers.

**The problem:** A café owner's critical business data is fragmented across
incompatible systems — a POS for sales, an espresso machine logging volumetrics,
and accounting software tracking P&L. No tool connects these data points into a
unified view purpose-built for coffee business decision-making. Owners make
consequential decisions based on gut feel because the data exists but is not
accessible in a useful form.

**The solution:** A custom-engineered business intelligence layer integrated directly
into Ully — connecting POS data, machine volumetrics, and accounting systems to
give the owner a real-time operational picture and AI-assisted decision support.
Built in-house, tailored for the coffee operator, not adapted from a generic BI tool.

**Phase 3 foundation already in place (Espresso Studios):**
The mobile business screens (`BusinessDashboardScreen`, `MaintenanceScreen`, `TeamScreen`)
and the full Ully Web platform give Phase 3 a significant head start. The missing piece is
the Firestore sync bridge — once live, mobile data feeds the web dashboard and the AI
layer has full operational context across both surfaces.

---

### Tool Integrations

#### Point of Sale — Square (v1)

Square is the most widely deployed POS in independent specialty cafés. The Square
API provides transaction-level data, item sales, and staff performance metrics.

**Data Ully ingests:**
- Daily, weekly, monthly revenue — by location, by shift, by item
- Top-selling items and revenue contribution by category
- Labour cost as a percentage of sales
- Hourly transaction volume — identifies peak and dead periods

**Ully AI layer:** Owner asks "Why was Tuesday revenue down 18%?" — Ully correlates
the POS data with weather, staffing, and prior week trends and surfaces a plain-
language answer with a recommended action.

**Future:** Toast, Lightspeed, and Kounta integrations follow the same pattern.
Square is prioritised because it covers the largest share of the target market.

#### Machine Volumetrics

**v1 — Manual input + photo analysis:**
Most commercial espresso machines do not expose data via API. The v1 approach
is structured manual input by the technician or head barista — shots pulled,
average extraction time, machine temperature log — with optional photo of the
shot or screen display.

**v2 — Native machine API (where supported):**
La Marzocco (Linea PB, KB90), Sanremo, and a growing number of commercial
machines expose Bluetooth or Wi-Fi APIs. Ully will integrate these where the
API is accessible, surfacing live group temperature, shot counter, and
boiler pressure directly in the app.

**Data Ully captures:**
- Daily shot count per group head
- Average extraction time and variance
- Temperature stability log
- Service interval proximity alert (feeds into maintenance schedules from Phase 2b)

#### QuickBooks Integration

**Target:** Café owners already using QuickBooks Online for accounting.

**Data Ully ingests (read-only OAuth connection):**
- Monthly P&L summary — revenue, COGS, gross margin
- Labour cost tracking against revenue
- Supplier invoices — cost-per-kg green coffee, consumables trend
- Cash flow position — current vs prior period

**Ully AI layer:** Owner asks "Am I on track to hit my margin target this quarter?"
Ully pulls the QuickBooks data, cross-references it with POS revenue, and
surfaces a direct answer with the specific levers available to close any gap.

**Implementation approach:** QuickBooks Online OAuth 2.0 + Intuit API. Read-only
scopes only — Ully never writes to the customer's accounting records.

---

### Business Intelligence Dashboard

A dedicated owner view inside Ully — not a web dashboard, but a native mobile
screen purpose-built for the café operator checking performance between shifts.

**Key views:**
- Today at a glance — revenue, covers, top item, machine status
- Weekly trend — revenue vs prior week, labour %, best and worst shifts
- Machine health — all machines, maintenance status, next service due
- Cost alerts — if COGS or labour crosses a set threshold, Ully flags it proactively
- AI summary — "Here is what your business data is telling you today"

**Who accesses this:** Business tier subscribers only. Individual barista accounts
on the same location see their training logs and shift performance only — not the
full P&L.

---

## Phase 4 — Ully Roaster

**Status:** Future. Follows the Business tier.

**Who it serves:** Independent roasters, head roasters, Q Graders, green coffee buyers.

**The problem:** Roasters rely on institutional knowledge and expensive, desktop-bound
software (Cropster, Artisan) that offers no AI-assisted guidance. Developing profiles
for new green coffees, diagnosing roast defects, and managing blend consistency are
solved by experience — not tools.

**Core features:**
- Roast profile development assistant — charge temp, first crack prediction, development ratio
- Green coffee intake — origin, variety, process, moisture, density logging
- Cupping score tracking — lot comparison, QC over time
- Blend formulation — target profile matching and component ratio adjustment
- Inventory management — green coffee freshness windows and lot aging alerts
- Roast defect troubleshooting (tipping, scorching, baked, underdeveloped)
- Direct connection to Ully Coffee consumer data — "what are baristas saying about this origin?"

**Why this follows Phase 3:**
- Requires the shared Firestore data layer established in the Business tier
- Roasters are reachable and willing to pay ($100–300/month per seat)
- Bridges the farm world and the consumer world in the crop-to-cup data platform
- Cropster integration or interop may be required — scope TBD

---

## Phase 5 — Ully Agriculture

**Status:** Future. Requires dedicated resourcing and regional partnerships.

**Who it serves:** Smallholder coffee farmers, cooperative managers, agronomists,
farm owners in producing regions (Ethiopia, Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala, Indonesia).

**The problem:** Over 70% of coffee is grown by smallholder farmers with under
5 hectares. Purpose-built technology tools are virtually nonexistent for this
population. Agronomic knowledge is passed down verbally or via infrequent extension
service visits. Climate change is accelerating crop stress. Actionable, localised
information saves harvests and livelihoods.

**Core features:**
- Plant disease identification from photos (coffee leaf rust, CBD, CLR, Anthracnose)
- Soil management — pH, nitrogen, micronutrients, amendment recommendations
- Harvest timing — cherry ripeness assessment via camera
- Processing method guidance — washed vs natural vs honey based on local conditions
- Yield forecasting and tracking
- Climate adaptation — altitude shifts, drought response, shade management
- Certification preparation — organic, Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, UTZ checklists
- Hyperlocal weather integration — forecast impact on harvest and processing decisions

**Technical requirements beyond current Ully stack:**
- Full offline capability — farms have no reliable connectivity
- Multi-language — Spanish, Amharic, Indonesian, Portuguese, Swahili
- Low-bandwidth optimisation — images compressed heavily before processing
- Firestore sync when connected — farm records persist across devices and seasons

**Revenue model:**
- Direct to cooperative or farm association (B2B, not individual farmer)
- NGO and impact investment partnerships (USAID, World Bank, Gates Foundation have
  active coffee agriculture programmes)
- Importer-funded access — importers pay per farm onboarded for supply chain traceability data

## The Crop-to-Cup Data Platform

**This is the long-term strategic asset.**

Each Ully vertical captures proprietary data at its node of the supply chain:

```
Ully Agriculture
  ↓  farm ID, soil data, variety, process, harvest date, certifications
Ully Logistics (future)
  ↓  lot tracking, shipping conditions, transit time, customs documentation
Ully Roaster
  ↓  green coffee intake, roast profile, cupping score, blend composition
Ully Business
  ↓  POS revenue, machine volumetrics, labour cost, consumer demand signals
Ully Coffee (current)
  ↓  barista technique, consumer feedback, brew method preference
```

When this data flows between verticals, Ully becomes a **traceability and quality
correlation platform** — the first tool that connects soil composition and farm
practice to cup quality and consumer preference at scale.

**This dataset does not exist anywhere.** It is Ully's long-term competitive moat.

### Consumer-facing traceability

A barista or consumer scans a QR code on a coffee bag and sees:
- Farm name, region, altitude, farmer name
- Harvest date, processing method, certifications
- Green coffee cupping score
- Roaster's profile notes
- Brewing recommendations from Ully AI

This transparency is demanded by specialty coffee buyers and increasingly required
by importers navigating EU deforestation regulation and ethical sourcing mandates.

## Vertical Expansion Beyond Coffee

After proving the model across the crop-to-cup chain, the platform architecture
applies directly to other skilled trades with the same professional identity,
operational knowledge gap, and mobile-first workflow characteristics.

**Prioritisation criteria:**
1. Low liability — advice cannot directly injure or kill
2. Strong professional community — word-of-mouth distribution
3. Underserved by existing software
4. Mobile-first workflow — field, not desk
5. Demonstrated willingness to pay for tools that save time

**Target verticals in priority order:**

| Vertical | Professionals served | Key use case |
|---|---|---|
| **Restaurant / F&B** | Chefs, kitchen managers, sommeliers | Kitchen ops, supplier management, recipe scaling, compliance |
| **Independent auto repair** | Mechanics, shop owners | Diagnosis assistance, repair procedures, parts lookup |
| **HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical** | Independent contractors | Troubleshooting, code compliance, part identification |
| **Agriculture (general)** | Farmers, agronomists | Crop disease identification, soil management, yield optimisation |
| **Welding / Fabrication** | Welders, fabricators | Procedure lookup, material compatibility, certification preparation |

**Regulated industries (aviation, medical, legal) — approach after Series A:**
These verticals carry real opportunity but require legal counsel, compliance
frameworks, and validation processes that are not appropriate until the platform
has proven revenue and has dedicated compliance resources in place.

## Business Model & Pricing

### Tier structure

| Tier | Price | What's included |
|---|---|---|
| **Free** | 14-day full Pro trial, then limited | 20 AI messages/day, read-only access to all platform data |
| **Pro** | $7.99/month or **$59.99/year** (~$5/mo) | Unlimited AI, shot history, full dial-in assistant, offline KB, training logs |
| **Business** | $49.99/location/month or **$399/location/year** (~$33/mo) | Everything in Pro + maintenance scheduling, POS integration, machine volumetrics, QuickBooks connection, team performance view, priority support |
| **Business Pro** | $79/location/month (contact us) | Everything in Business + multi-location dashboard, custom AI on SOPs, API access, 4-hour SLA |
| **Technician Lifetime** | $149 one-time (first 100 CTG members) | Full Pro forever — seeding the highest-leverage professional community |

### Pricing anchors (2026 market-validated)

- **$7.99/month Pro** — baristas earn $14-19/hr; $9.99 was a psychological barrier. $7.99 clears it.
- **$59.99/year Pro** — 37% off monthly, ~$5/month equivalent. Standard for consumer apps (Duolingo, Calm, Headspace).
- **$49.99/location Business** — 7shifts charges $76.99/location for scheduling alone. Ully includes scheduling + equipment + team + training + inventory + P&L + AI. Market floor for any scheduling tool is $35/location/month.
- **$79/location Business Pro** — parity with Cropster ($79+/month for roast management only). Ully delivers the full ops stack.
- **Dripos** (closest all-in-one competitor) charges $160/month and requires POS hardware. Ully Web at $49.99 is 70% cheaper, no hardware lock-in, AI-native.
- **Positioning line**: "Everything 7shifts charges for scheduling — plus equipment, AI, inventory, and P&L. Same price."
- Launch with a 14-day full trial, no credit card. After trial: paid plan or read-only mode (not hard cutoff).
- Annual plans should be the default selection on pricing pages — annual subscribers churn at half the rate of monthly.

### Business model evolution

### Three product moves — deferred, design decisions captured

High-leverage features to build post-WoC. Design decisions are resolved —
implementation is ready to start when prioritised.

---

**1. Shift Mode**

One-tap mode that sets the AI to maximum brevity for on-shift, time-pressure,
greasy-hand environments. Distinct from the current "short and practical" default —
Shift Mode removes all context and explanation entirely.

| Normal Mode | Shift Mode |
|---|---|
| Answer + brief context | Answer only |
| "Here's why this happens..." | Removed |
| "You might also consider..." | Removed |
| Multi-paragraph when complex | One paragraph hard cap |

**UX decision (resolved):** Gold chip in the AI screen header, always visible.
Active state is gold-filled. Sticky across sessions — saved to AsyncStorage so a
technician does not re-enable it every morning.

**Implementation:** System prompt flag in `useUllyChat.ts`. Add a `shiftMode`
boolean to the hook, persist to AsyncStorage under `@ully_shift_mode_{uid}`,
inject a secondary brevity override into `buildSystemPrompt()` when active.

---

**2. Dial-in Shot History**

Save each dial-in session to AsyncStorage. Creates a longitudinal data trail
that no competitor offers. Foundation for the future crop-to-cup data layer.

**UX decision (resolved):** History lives inside the dial-in modal as a "History"
tab — contextual, no navigation away from the dial-in flow. Scrollable list of
previous sessions with dose, yield, time, taste, and the AI recommendation.

**AsyncStorage key:** `@ully_dialin_{uid}`

**Schema per session:**
```ts
{
  id: string
  createdAt: string
  dose: number
  yield: number
  time: number
  taste: 'sour' | 'balanced' | 'bitter'
  imageUri?: string
  aiRecommendation: string
  notes?: string
}
```

**Implementation:** Save on dial-in submission in `AIScreen.tsx`. Read and display
in a new History tab in `DialInModal`.

---

**3. Share This Fix**

Share icon on every Ully AI response — not just diagnostic responses. The user
decides what is worth sharing; do not try to detect intent.

**UX decision (resolved):** Small share icon at the bottom-right of each assistant
message bubble. Not shown on user messages. Shown only on the most recent assistant
response in a conversation to avoid visual noise.

**Share format:**
```
💡 Ully AI — Espresso Assistant

[full response text]

─────────────────
Get Ully: [App Store / Play Store link]
```

**Implementation:** `Share.share()` from React Native core in
`components/ai/ChatHistory.tsx`. No new dependencies.

### Key dates — 2026 industry calendar

| Date | Event | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **April 10–12** | World of Coffee San Diego | **Attend. Primary launch window.** |
| May 7–9 | World of Coffee Asia, Bangkok | International press hook |
| June 25–27 | World of Coffee Europe, Brussels | iOS global launch story |
| TBD | CTG Summit 2026 | Single best event for the technician ICP |
| October 23–25 | World Barista Championship, Panama City | 6-month story + WBC content push |

## Principles That Do Not Change

1. **Coffee-only** in the coffee product. Domain focus is the product.
2. **No analytics SDK.** No Mixpanel, no Amplitude. Privacy is a feature, not a footnote.
3. **On-device first.** User data stays on the user's device unless they explicitly choose to share it.
4. **No preamble.** Ully answers immediately. Every product built on this platform follows the same rule.
5. **Mobile-first.** Professionals are not at desks. Every feature must work one-handed, outdoors, in a loud environment.
6. **The KB is proprietary.** Curated domain expertise is the moat — protect it.
7. **Integrations are purpose-built.** Ully connects to third-party tools (POS, QuickBooks, machine APIs) on its own terms — custom-engineered for the professional's workflow, never a generic connector.
